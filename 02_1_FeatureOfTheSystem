# Feature of the System

### Formal Method of Gathering Functional Requirements

+ Ask the client to describe everything they need? - not a good method for complex systems.
+ More powerful method of gathering requirements
    - Use Cases
        * situation/Scenario in which our system is used.
    - User Flows
        * A Step-By-Step / Graphical representation of each use case.

### Requirement Gathering Steps
1. Identify all the actors/users in our system.
2. Capture and describe all the possible use-cases/ scenarios
3. User Flow - Expand each use case through flow of events
    - Each event contains
        * Action
        * Data

### Uber Service - Gathering requirements
    "Allow *people to join *drivers on a route, who are willing to take passengers for a fee"
1. Actors: drivers, passengers
2. find use-cases
    - Driver registration
    - Rider registration
    - Driver login
    - Rider login
    - Successful match and ride
    - Unsuccessful ride
3. Sequence diagram - a visual way the document in the interaction between actors and different components of our system
